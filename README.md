7. Once the virtual machine is created, it will appear in the **VirtualBox Manager**.
8. Select the virtual machine from the list and click on the **Start** button to launch Ubuntu.

### Part 2: Writing and Evaluating C Code with GCC Compiler

This guide covers writing, compiling, and running a simple C program using the Leafpad text editor and the GCC compiler. It is designed to help beginners get started with C programming in a straightforward and structured manner.

#### 1. Install Leafpad Text Editor
Leafpad is a lightweight text editor with a simple and user-friendly interface, making it ideal for beginners. It provides a distraction-free environment for writing code without unnecessary complexity.

To install Leafpad, use the following command:

```sh
sudo apt install leafpad
```
![image](./Task1/hardware.png)

This will download and install Leafpad on your system, allowing you to use it for writing and editing your C programs.

#### 2. Navigate to the Home Directory
Before creating or editing files, ensure you are in the home directory. Organizing your files in a dedicated workspace prevents confusion and makes file management more efficient.

Use the following command to navigate to the home directory:

   ```sh
   cd ~
   ```

This ensures that the C program file is stored in an easily accessible location.

#### 3. Write a Simple C Program
To write your C program, open Leafpad and create a new file named `sum1ton.c` using the command:

   ```sh
   leafpad sum1ton.c &
   ```
   ![image](./Task1/hardware.png)

The ampersand (`&`) allows Leafpad to run in the background, so you can continue using the terminal.

***Example C Program (sum1ton.c):***
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       int i, sum = 0, n = 5;
       for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
           sum += i;
       }
       printf("Sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

***Explanation of the Code:***
1. **Header File Inclusion**: `#include <stdio.h>` imports the Standard Input and Output library, which is necessary for using the `printf` function.
2. **Variable Declaration**: Three integer variables are declared:
   - `i` is used as the loop counter.
   - `sum` stores the cumulative sum of numbers.
   - `n` represents the upper limit of the summation (set to 5).
3. **For Loop**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n`.
   - Each iteration adds the value of `i` to `sum`.
4. **Output Statement**:
   - The `printf` function prints the calculated sum.
5. **Return Statement**:
   - The `return 0;` statement indicates that the program has executed successfully.

#### 4. Compile the C Code
Before running the program, we must compile it using GCC. Compilation translates human-readable C code into a machine-executable binary format.

Use the following command to compile the code:

   ```sh
   gcc sum1ton.c -o sum1ton
   ```

***Explanation of Compilation:***
- `gcc` is the GNU Compiler Collection, used to compile C programs.
- `sum1ton.c` is the source code file.
- `-o sum1ton` specifies the output file name (`sum1ton`). Without this option, GCC generates a default executable named `a.out`.
- If there are syntax errors in your code, the compiler will display error messages to help you debug them.

#### 5. Run the Compiled Program
Once the program is compiled successfully, you can execute it by running:

   ```sh
   ./a.out
   ```
   ![image](./Task1/hardware.png)

***Expected Output:***
   ```sh
   Sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is 15
   ```

This confirms that the program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `1` to `5`.

#### 6. Additional Notes
***Installing GCC***

If GCC is not installed on your system, you can install it using:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install gcc
   ```

***Enabling Warnings***

To compile the program with warnings enabled, use:
   ```sh
   gcc -Wall sum1ton.c -o sum1ton
   ```
This helps catch potential issues in your code, such as unused variables or incorrect format specifiers.

***Running the Program with Different Values***

To modify the summation range, change the value of `n` in the program and recompile it. This allows you to experiment with different inputs and understand how loops work in C.

Hereâ€™s a detailed and well-structured GitHub README file for compiling C code using the RISC-V compiler. It includes in-depth explanations of each step, key commands, and optimization options.


### **Compiling C Code with RISC-V Compiler**  

This guide explains how to compile C programs using the **RISC-V GCC Compiler**, examine the generated assembly code, and optimize the compilation process.  


***Introduction to RISC-V Compilation***

RISC-V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that is widely used for embedded systems, computer architecture research, and hardware development. To run C programs on a RISC-V architecture, we need to compile them using a specialized **RISC-V GCC toolchain**.

This guide walks through:
1. **Compiling C code with the RISC-V GCC compiler**
2. **Inspecting the generated assembly code**
3. **Understanding different optimization levels**
4. **Interpreting key RISC-V compiler flags**


***Prerequisites***

Before compiling your code, ensure you have the **RISC-V GNU toolchain** installed. You can verify the installation using:

```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version
```

If not installed, you can set it up using:
```sh
sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf
```

#### **1. Compiling C Code Using the RISC-V Compiler**
To compile a C file with the **RISC-V GCC compiler**, run the following command:  

```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o filename.o filename.c
```
 ![image](./Task1/riscv_compiler.png)

### **Explanation of Command Options**
| **Option**              | **Description** |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| `-O1`                 | Optimization level 1 (balances compilation time and performance) |
| `-mabi=lp64`          | Specifies the **LP64 ABI** (64-bit long, pointer, integer) |
| `-march=rv64i`        | Specifies the **RISC-V 64-bit Integer** instruction set |
| `-o filename.o`       | Outputs the compiled object file |

Replace **filename.c** with your actual C source file.



#### **2. Listing the Compiled Object File**
Once compiled, verify the creation of the **object file**:

```sh
ls -ltr filename.o
```

If the compilation was successful, you should see the object file (`filename.o`) listed.

#### **3. Displaying the Assembly Code**
To view the **assembly language output** of your C code, use the following command:

```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d filename.o
```
 ![image](./Task1/assembly_code.png)
 
This will **disassemble** the compiled object file and show the **low-level assembly instructions** generated from your C code.

#### **4. Viewing Optimized Assembly Code**
To inspect the assembly output more conveniently, you can **pipe** it through `less`:

```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d filename.o | less
```
 ![image](./Task1/optimized_assembly.png)
 
***Navigation Tips:***
- Press **"/main"** to search for the `main` function.  
- Use **arrow keys** or **Page Up/Down** to scroll through the output.  
- Press **q** to exit.

 ![image](./Task1/main_instructions.png)
 
#### **5. Using a Higher Optimization Level (-Ofast)**
For **maximum performance optimization**, you can use the `-Ofast` flag:

```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```
 ![image](./Task1/main_instructions2.png)
 
***Breakdown of Compiler Flags***
| **Option**              | **Description** |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| `-Ofast`              | Aggressive optimizations for **maximum speed** |
| `-mabi=lp64`          | Uses LP64 ABI (64-bit architecture) |
| `-march=rv64i`        | Compiles for the **64-bit RISC-V** architecture |
| `sum1ton.o`           | Output object file |
| `sum1ton.c`           | Input C source file |

***Why Use -Ofast?*** 
- Enables all optimizations of `-O3` plus aggressive floating-point optimizations.
- Ignores strict compliance with IEEE floating-point standards (faster but less precise).

**Note:** Use `-Ofast` only if speed is critical, as it may lead to unexpected behavior in some cases.

#### **6. Optimization Levels in RISC-V GCC**
The RISC-V GCC compiler supports various optimization levels:

| **Optimization Level** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| `-O0`                 | No optimization (default). Fast compilation but **slow execution**. |
| `-O1`                 | Basic optimizations, balances **speed and compilation time**. |
| `-O2`                 | More aggressive optimizations than `-O1`, improves performance. |
| `-O3`                 | Maximizes optimization, **more aggressive loop and memory optimizations**. |
| `-Os`                 | Optimizes code size instead of speed. |
| `-Ofast`              | Maximum performance optimizations, ignoring strict IEEE standards. |

***When to Use Different Levels?***
- Use `-O0` when debugging.
- Use `-O2` for **general-purpose** applications.
- Use `-O3` for **compute-heavy** applications.
- Use `-Ofast` for **speed-critical** programs.

#### **7. Understanding RISC-V Compilation Terms**
***RISC-V ABI (`-mabi=lp64`)***
The **Application Binary Interface (ABI)** defines **how functions interact** in compiled code.  
- **LP64**: 64-bit `long`, pointer, and integer types.  
- Required for **64-bit** RISC-V programs.

***RISC-V Architecture (`-march=rv64i`)***
- `rv64i`: The **64-bit integer** base instruction set for RISC-V.
- Ensures compatibility with **RISC-V 64-bit processors**.

***RISCV-OBJDUMP (`riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d`)***
- Used to **disassemble** object files into **assembly code**.
- Helps **debug and analyze** the generated machine instructions.

## TASK 2: Running and Debugging sum_1ton.c on SPIKE Simulator

### Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to compile and run the `sum_1ton.c` program using both the GCC compiler and the RISC-V compiler. The goal is to ensure that both compilers produce the same output on the terminal. Additionally, the guide includes details on running the compiled RISC-V program on the SPIKE simulator and debugging it.

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- GCC Compiler
- RISC-V Compiler (riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc)
- SPIKE RISC-V ISA Simulator
- Proxy Kernel (pk)

### Compiling the Code

#### Using GCC Compiler
To compile `filename.c` using the GCC compiler, run the following command:

```sh
$ gcc -o filename filename.c
```

This will generate an executable file named `sum1ton` which can be executed directly on your system.

```sh
$ ./filename
```
 ![image](./Task2/gcc_comp.png)

#### Using RISC-V Compiler
To compile the program for RISC-V architecture, use the following command:

```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o filename.o filename.c
```
 ![image](./Task2/riscv_comp.png)

This will create an object file `sum1ton.o`, which can be executed on a RISC-V simulator like SPIKE.

#### Viewing Optimized Assembly Code
To inspect the assembly output more conveniently, you can **pipe** it through `less`:

```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d filename.o | less
```
 ![image](./Task2/assembly.png)
 
### Running the Program on SPIKE Simulator
To execute the compiled RISC-V program using the SPIKE simulator, use the following command:

```sh
$ spike pk filename.o
```
 ![image](./Task2/execute.png)

This command runs the program on the SPIKE simulator using the Proxy Kernel (pk).

### Debugging and Viewing Assembly in SPIKE
For a detailed execution view, SPIKE provides debugging options. To enable debugging, run:

```sh
$ spike -d pk filename.o
```
 ![image](./Task2/debug.png)

Once inside the debugging mode, you will see a sequence of RISC-V assembly instructions being executed. You can step through each instruction, inspect registers, and examine memory addresses interactively.


### **Disassembly Breakdown**

Each line of the assembly code represents a machine instruction, along with its memory address, opcode, and corresponding assembly mnemonic.

#### **1. Function Setup (Prologue)**

```assembly
100b0:  00021537   lui     a0, 0x21        # Load upper immediate 0x21 into a0
100b4:  ff010113   addi    sp, sp, -16     # Allocate 16 bytes on stack (adjust stack pointer)
```

- `lui a0, 0x21` â†’ Loads the upper 20 bits of `a0` with `0x21`.
- `addi sp, sp, -16` â†’ Allocates 16 bytes on the stack to store local variables and the return address.

#### **2. Argument Preparation for **``

```assembly
100b8:  00f00613   li      a2, 15          # Load immediate 15 into a2 (third argument)
100bc:  00500593   li      a1, 5           # Load immediate 5 into a1 (second argument)
100c0:  18050513   addi    a0, a0, 384     # Compute full address 0x21180 (first argument)
```

- `li a2, 15` â†’ Loads `15` into `a2`, likely used as a parameter for `printf`.
- `li a1, 5` â†’ Loads `5` into `a1`, another argument for `printf`.
- `addi a0, a0, 384` â†’ Completes the address computation (`0x21180`), likely a format string for `printf`.

#### **3. Save Return Address**

```assembly
100c4:  00113423   sd      ra, 8(sp)       # Save return address (ra) to stack
```

- Stores `ra` (return address) at `8(sp)`, so it can be restored later.

#### **4. Function Call (**``**)**

```assembly
100c8:  340000ef   jal     ra, 10408 <printf>  # Call `printf`
```

- `jal ra, 10408` â†’ Calls `printf`, storing the return address in `ra`.

#### **5. Return Value Handling**

```assembly
100cc:  00813083   ld      ra, 8(sp)       # Restore return address from stack
100d0:  00000513   li      a0, 0           # Load 0 into a0 (return 0)
```

- `ld ra, 8(sp)` â†’ Restores the return address.
- `li a0, 0` â†’ Loads `0` into `a0`, indicating a successful return.

#### **6. Stack Cleanup and Function Return**

```assembly
100d4:  01010113   addi    sp, sp, 16      # Restore stack pointer
100d8:  00008067   ret                     # Return to caller
```

- `addi sp, sp, 16` â†’ Deallocates the stack space.
- `ret` â†’ Returns to the calling function.
